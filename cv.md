## About me

I am a trainee Front-end developer. Currently I am studying at the Rolling Scopes School.
My goal to start is to become a junior Front-end developer. Now I devote to developing my skills in this direction, and specifically studying: HTML, CSS and basics JavaScript
My experience comes from some of the marathons and online trainings I have taken. Some mini-projects can be viewed at this link [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/user/bomber156/fiddles/)

I passed Quick Check from EFSet and my result is somewhere between B1 Intermediate and B2 Upper Intermediate ![My results](https://ci4.googleusercontent.com/proxy/byIQVbyvQ8Hs0E25M-bsqlIKzcNSS098gEugf603kBYPkMDQT6xQ_s2EcnpPCVf3l_ireNj-ocM8LJOwH99MSWQO3-hxhO9XbSSyh5oU6RYI-PIOFhjDmIWUkA=s0-d-e1-ft#https://cdn.efset.org/efset-media-assets/percentage-scores/badges/70.png)
